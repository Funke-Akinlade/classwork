# 🌐 My First Web App

A beginner-friendly frontend project created by Funke  during the summer holidays to learn the fundamentals of HTML and web development.



About the Project

This project is a simple personal webpage that introduces the developer, lists their hobbies, displays current tasks, and includes a contact form.

It is built using  HTML & CSS and is aimed at practicing:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Page layout with sections
- Navigation bar
- Embedding images and lists
- Creating a contact form



 What I Learned

- Structuring web pages with `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Using anchor links for navigation
- Adding images and organizing content into columns
- Creating forms with input fields and textarea elements
- Improving HTML formatting and accessibility
